There are different stages of the Jenkinsfile which has to be written in the pipeline.


1. All the stages come under the pipeline block.
2. After that, the variables used in different stages are defined.
3. The tools used in the pipeline, such as Docker, Node, etc., are specified.
4. Then the stages begin. The number of stages depends on the requirements of the process.
5. When there is a need for code debugging, a test and debug stage is added, utilizing different tools for code debugging, as needed.
6. If there are many steps involved in one stage, they are written in the steps block within that particular stage.
7. After the completion of all stages, the success and failure blocks are written, containing messages for success and failure.
